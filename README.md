# Binary-Search-Tree

I created this project to enhance my understanding of Binary Search Trees (BST) and their operations. This implementation, written in Python, allows users to insert, delete, and search for nodes in a BST while visualizing the structure dynamically. By working on this project, I aimed to build a deeper intuition for how BSTs function and improve my problem-solving skills in data structures.

This project provides an interactive way to explore BST operations. It enables users to visualize how elements are added to the tree, how deletions affect its structure, and how searches navigate through nodes. The dynamic nature of the visualization helps reinforce key BST concepts.

The project is built using Python for backend logic and utilizes graphical libraries for visualization. The script allows users to input values, and the tree updates in real-time to reflect changes. This makes it easier to grasp how a BST maintains its properties and balance after each operation.

To use this project, simply run the Python script, and a graphical interface will allow you to interact with the tree. You can insert nodes, delete specific values, and search for elements within the BST. The visualization dynamically updates to reflect changes, providing an educational and engaging experience.

I built this project as a learning tool and plan to expand it further. Future improvements could include adding support for AVL trees, implementing different traversal animations, and optimizing performance for larger datasets. I hope this project helps others gain a better understanding of Binary Search Trees, just as it did for me.
